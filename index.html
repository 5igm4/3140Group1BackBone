			<h1>Project One</h1>

			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>This project is about writing Swing and graphics code, and, along the way, you'll subclass classes, implement interfaces, and generally dig in to Java's brand of object-oriented programming. I've given you some skeleton code that provides the infrastucture for a simple graphical game. Think <a href="http://www.ponggame.org/">Pong</a> or <a href="http://www.freeasteroids.org/">Asteroids</a>. I'll ask you to implement a game with some basic behaviors, but the details of the game are up to you. But be thinking: how to make your game a two-player game? What if it could be played across a network? That's something we might explore in project 2.
			</p>

			<h2>Objectives</h2>

			Through your work on this project, you will advance your ability to:

			<ul>
				<li>Work with code provided by others.</li>
				<li>Write basic graphics and GUI code in Java.</li>
				<li>Create basic  object-oriented designs.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The Project</h2>

			<p>As usual, start by logging in to your GitHub account and look for the repository for <code>project1</code> (the name of the repository should include your GitHub username, e.g. <code>sdexter72-project1</code>. Copy the URL of the repository, then <strong>clone</strong> it into your Eclipse workspace. You should see a project called <code>Project1</code>, which contains three source files. Run the project: you should see a blue circle drifting down across a black background: not much of a game.</p>

			<p>Your task is to complete this program so that it runs in accordance with the specifications below. You should <strong>commit</strong> your code frequently, and <strong>push</strong> your commits at the end of each work session (if not more frequently).</p>

			
			<h3>Introduction to The Skeleton</h3>
			<p>
			Most of the code in the skeleton is very closely related to what we've seen in the book and lecture. Perhaps the only big new thing is the Swing <code>Timer</code> class, which basically issues <code>ActionPerformed</code> events at a fixed frequency. Look at the code that uses the <code>Timer</code>: who handles those events? How does handling those events relate to the "animation" of the game? 
			</p>

			<p>
	The other slightly interesting thing is the <code>GameObject</code> class. This is intended to represent, at a fairly general level, the behavior of any graphic elements that will appear in the game. Each object occupies a certain part of the gameboard and has some speed in the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> directions. Notice that the <code>GameObject</code> class doesn't say much about the how object is actually supposed to be drawn on the screen: that's a question for the game itself to decide. You <strong>must not</strong>	alter the <code>GameObject</code> class, with two exceptions: you need to implement the <code>collide()</code> method and the <code>bounce()</code> method. Of course, you may extend <code>GameObject</code> if you need a class with more specialized behavior.	
			</p>

			<h3>Game Logic</h3>

			<p>You need to decide what your game is about. Are you shooting things? Catching things? Bouncing balls around? Something nuttier? Once you've decided on that, you can think about your object-oriented design: for example, do you need to subclass <code>GameObject</code>? </p>

			<p>You also need to decide how your game will be controlled. Mouse? Keyboard? What events are the relevant ones for your game? Which object(s) need to listen for these events? Should it be the <code>GamePanel</code>, or a particular <code>GameObject</code>, or...?</p>

			<p>When is the <strong>Game Over</strong>? (Or is it never over...)</p>

			<h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>
			So, your game needs to have the following minimum characteristics:
			<ol><li>It responds to user controls in an appropriate way. This can be iether mouse or keyboard control, depending on the needs of your game</li>

				<li>You must implement the <code>collide()</code> method and use this to affect the game logic&mdash;in almost every game of this sort, the collision of two objects is significant (an object got shot, or caught, or bounced off something, or whatever)</li>

				<li>You must write a class that either <code>extends</code> or <code>implements</code>. </li></ol>

			<h3>Other Design Issues</h3>

			As you're working, keep your eyes open for ways to improve the design of your code. Make sure objects are responsible for their own behavior, make sure you're taking advantage of the API, where you can. And make sure the logic of <code>GamePanel</code> is well-written and efficient (you know how I hate duplicate code). What if your game could have many <code>GameObject</code>s in play at once? Is there a  sequence of steps you find yourself always going through, one that might be best put in a helper method?

			<h2>Submission and Grading</h2>

			<p>Your project is due by 9pm, Thursday, November 12. (I will plan to clone your repositories after class that evening.) I will only grade/consider code in the <code>master</code> branch of your GitHub repository; this repository should contain exactly one Eclipse project that itself contains exactly one <code>main()</code> method. Projects that do not compile, or which crash with unhandled exceptions, will lose 50 points.</p>
			

			<p>I will grade out of 100 points, allocated as follows:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><b>Documentation: 25 points</b>. Your project should include revised documentation in the <code>doc</code> folder. For classes/methods that you don't change, you don't need to change the documentation. Obviously, add documentation for classes you create. For methods/classes that <em>change</em>, <em>delete</em> my doccomments and replace them with your own. Yours must all begin with the word <code>CHANGED</code> so that I can locate them easily. Be sure to use Eclipse's "Generate Javadocs..." function to generate the new documentation, and double-check the javadocs to make sure all the documentation you wrote appears there.<p>

						<p>Also, revise the <code>README.md</code> file. It should have three main sections. First, "Description and Instructions." Briefly describe the game and its objective(s), and tell me how to play it (what are the controls? what are the objectives?). Next, "Works Cited." I expect you will need to consult a variety of resources to complete this project. Any website, book, or similar resource from which you get useful guidance must be listed here, along with a brief description of what you got from it (a bit of code? an explanation? an answer to a question?). You do not need to list the Java API or either of the two books required/recommended for class. If you use no other resources, then your "Works Cited" section must simply contain the word <em>None</em>. Finally, "Code Summary." In this section, just list your <em>new</em> classes and methods and your <em>changed</em> classes and methods.  to include a brief summary of the methods and classes you changed. If you do any work for extra credit, then add a section on "Extra Credit" that briefly lists the extra credit features you successfully implemented.
				</li>

				<li><p><b>Design: 25 points</b>. Are the relationships among your classes (and the way they interact with the Java library classes) logical, clear, and robust? Do they (for example) adhere to the IS-A and HAS-A rules? Is your code otherwise well-designed, e.g. avoiding duplicate code?</p></li>


				<li><p><b>Style and "Java Thinking:" 25 points</b>. Your code should be properly formatted, with enough (but not too much) whitespace. Eclipse will do most of this for you; make sure you let it help you. Variable names, method names, etc, should all be "self-documenting" but not excessively long. <em>Generally</em>, you can use any style you like, as long as you're consistent. If you're not sure what style to use, follow the <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html">Google Style Guide</a>, except where Eclipse's automatic formatting contradicts these guidelines. There is <strong>no excuse</strong> for unreadable code, and I will grade you pretty severely if you don't take the time to make your code readable.</p>
					<p>In addition, you should strive to write your code in a Java mindset. Don't write code to do something that's already in the API.</p></li>

				<li><p><b>Correctness and Efficiency: 25 points</b>. Does your game "play properly?" Does it offer at least the minimum set of behaviors described above? Does it do so efficiently, without wasting computation?</p></li>

				<p>


			</ol>

			<p>
				On this project,  you are to work strictly
				<em>on your own</em>. Specifically, you may neither show
				your code to, nor look at the code of, anyone else taking
				3120 this semester. You may consult online/textbook
				resources (subject to the "Documentation" requirements
				above). You may certainly consult with me. You may, if you
				like, discuss your design at a high level with other
				students ("Oh, I found the
				<code>java.foo.bar</code>
				package to be really helpful," or, "Sure, I can explain the
				geometry of a paint window to you.").</p>

			<p>
				You can earn up to 10 points extra credit by implementing
				extra behaviors. Any extra behaviors you provide should be
				listed briefly in the
				<code>README.md</code>. For example, you might want to give your players multiples lives (or the ability to earn them), and/or you might want to disply a running score.
